# 📘 MetricFlow – Real-time System Monitoring Dashboard

**MetricFlow** is a full-stack project that shows real-time data about your system like CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and how often certain API endpoints are being hit.  
It's great for learning how real-time dashboards work and how to connect frontend + backend using **WebSockets** and **REST APIs**.
